# Discord Linked Roles Profile Card
You might know that discord recently rolled out a new feature called "Linked Roles", that allows to get role if you connect some social media account.
But only a certain amount of people know that you can use a special bot with those linked role to get a custom card with any text you want in your profile on server. You can read more about it <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members">Official Discord website<a>

The Discord has released this feature recently and there are no free working solutions on the Internet, so I spend a lot of time creating one on my own. Buying it you'll get a configured bot for your own purposes with a comprehensive installation guide and my help if 
something will go wrong instead of a raw piece of code. The prices are pretty low, starting at $15 so I think it's really a great deal.
